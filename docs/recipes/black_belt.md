This is a collection of advanced fully complete AstroNvim user configurations for reference:

- [mehalter](https://git.mehalter.com/mehalter/AstroNvim_user) - Fully separated into individual files, shows that the `init.lua` file is not necessary...
- [datamonsterr](https://github.com/datamonsterr/astrovim_config) - Another approach to a very modular and well organized `user/` configuration folder
- [hunger](https://github.com/hunger/AstroVim/tree/my_config/lua/user) - Great set up for Rust development with all the rust tools for LSP and Debugger set up
